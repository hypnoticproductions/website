# META PROMPT: THE TERRAIN ENGINE
## For MiniMax 2.1 Website Builder

---

## SYSTEM CONTEXT

You are building a website for **The Terrain Engine** — a cognitive infrastructure system developed by **Richard D. Fortune (Vor'thalis)**, founder of **Dopa-Tech** and **Fortune Tech Ventures**, based in **St. Lucia, Caribbean**.

This is not a typical SaaS product. This is a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration. The website must communicate this clearly without being abstract or inaccessible.

---

## THE CORE CONCEPT

### What The Terrain Engine Is

The Terrain Engine is a system that:
- **Maps** human complexity into navigable structure
- **Bores tunnels** through obstacles (not climbs over them)
- **Creates permanent routes** that others can walk

**The Metaphor:**

Traditional software gives you a flashlight.
AI assistants give you a guide who guesses.
The Terrain Engine gives you:
- A satellite map of where you are
- A geological scan of what's blocking you
- Tunnels already bored through the hardest rock
- And a foreman who remembers every route ever taken

**The Philosophy:**

> "We don't climb mountains. We blast tunnels through them. When the tunnel is complete, the route is permanent."

## THE ARCHITECTURE

### Three Layers

```
LAYER 1: PRODUCTS (What users interact with)
├── Harvester — Legal case preparation AI
├── SafeTravel — Travel risk intelligence
├── WUKR Wire — Content syndication engine
└── Morphic Trade Axis — Cross-border investment infrastructure

LAYER 2: INFRASTRUCTURE (What powers the products)
├── WorkrWire — The nervous system connecting intention to outcome
├── MANUS — The AI foreman orchestrating execution
└── Knowledge Base — Memory of every route taken

LAYER 3: PARADIGM (What makes it different)
└── The Terrain Engine — Cognitive mapping, not task automation
```

## TONE AND VOICE GUIDELINES

### Do:

- Be confident without being arrogant
- Explain complex ideas simply
- Ground abstract concepts in tangible outcomes
- Use "we" for the company, "you" for the visitor

### Don't:
- Use jargon without explanation
- Be vague or purely philosophical
- Oversell or make unverifiable claims
- Mix metaphors (stick to geological/terrain)
- Sound like typical startup copy

### Voice Examples:

**Good:** "Harvester doesn't just read your documents. It maps the contradictions, builds a timeline, and shows you where the case breaks open."

**Bad:** "Harvester leverages cutting-edge AI to revolutionize legal workflows."

**Good:** "The Morphic Trade Axis is a tunnel connecting Caribbean capital to Ugandan opportunity — bypassing the banks, the fees, and the gatekeepers."

**Bad:** "Our innovative fintech solution disrupts traditional cross-border investment paradigms."
