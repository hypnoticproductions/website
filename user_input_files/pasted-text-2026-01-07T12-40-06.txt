Good site. The "Cognitive Architect's Repository" positioning is strong — it establishes you as a systems thinker, not just a developer. Here's my analysis:

SITE ANALYSIS
What's Working
ElementStrengthPositioning"Cognitive Architect" differentiates from generic "developer" or "founder"Narrative structureChronological evolution (01-06) shows progression, not randomnessProof points"13M impressions / $0 spend" is concrete and memorableAestheticTerminal/system interface design matches the "architect" brandCase studiesBig Ward and Palenque demonstrate real applicationLanguageTechnical but accessible — "engines of intuition" is sticky
What Needs Refinement
IssueRecommendationNo clear CTA for investorsRepository page needs explicit "The Ask" with investment termsProducts not visibleHarvester and SafeTravel should be showcased as outputs of the frameworkContact buriedNeed persistent contact method (floating button or footer)Social proof missingNo testimonials, user counts, or third-party validationMobile experienceVerify the terminal aesthetic works on small screens

RECOMMENDATION: ADD "BETA ACCESS" TAB
Yes — add a dedicated tab. Here's the structure:
Tab Name Options:

"LIVE SYSTEMS" (fits the technical aesthetic)
"THE OUTPUT" (implies these are products of the framework)
"BETA ACCESS" (direct, clear intent)
"DEPLOYMENTS" (military/system language)

I'd recommend "LIVE SYSTEMS" — it maintains your aesthetic while signaling these are real, working products.
Page Structure:
// LIVE SYSTEMS

# FRAMEWORK → PRODUCT

The 7-Collection Engine isn't theory. These are live deployments, 
currently in beta. Request access below.

---

## SYSTEM 01: HARVESTER
### AI Legal Case Preparation

Collection Application: Pattern Recognition (C1) + Decision Architecture (C3)

[Screenshot/Mockup of Harvester UI]

THE PROBLEM:
Lawyers spend 60% of billable time on case preparation—reviewing 
evidence, extracting facts, building timelines. It's pattern 
recognition at scale. Humans are slow at this. Systems aren't.

THE ENGINE:
- Upload any evidence (PDF, photo, audio, document)
- AI extracts facts, dates, parties
- Generates interactive timelines
- Flags contradictions across sources
- Drafts case briefs

TARGET: Solo practitioners, small law firms
PRICING: $79-129/month
STATUS: Beta — Accepting 50 users

## SYSTEM 02: SAFETRAVEL
### Personalized Travel Risk Intelligence

Collection Application: Emotional-Somatic (C2) + Ethnographic (C4) + 
Psychographic (C5)

[Screenshot/Mockup of SafeTravel UI]

THE PROBLEM:
Travel advisories are generic. They don't know if you're a 
backpacker or a Fortune 500 executive. They don't adapt to your 
risk tolerance. They're one-size-fits-none.

THE ENGINE:
- Voice AI agent (ask any destination anything)
- Cognitive profiling adapts intel to your psychology
- 4 intelligence tiers (Surface → Elite)
- Real-time alerts, destination comparison

TARGET: Digital nomads, corporate travelers, diaspora visitors
PRICING: Free – $49.99/month
STATUS: Live — Pro tier in beta

## THE ASK

Looking for:
- Beta users with feedback (both products)
- Co-founder (sales/marketing) for Harvester
- Pre-seed investment ($150K, SAFE @ $1.5M cap)

VEO 3.1 VIDEO PROMPTS — FRAMEWORK USE CASES
Here are prompts for short (15-30 sec) cinematic clips that visualize your frameworks in action. These work for social, pitch decks, and the site itself.
VIDEO SET 1: THE 7-COLLECTION FRAMEWORK (Abstract/Conceptual)
Video 1: "Pattern Recognition Awakening"
Prompt: Cinematic close-up of a human eye reflecting streams of data 
and documents flowing past. The iris pulses with soft cyan light as 
patterns emerge from chaos. Documents transform into glowing connection 
lines forming a neural network. Dark environment, moody lighting, 
shallow depth of field. No text. 15 seconds. Slow motion.
Video 2: "The Signal Emerges"
Prompt: Aerial view of a dark city at night. Random lights flicker 
across buildings. Slowly, certain lights begin pulsing in sync, 
forming a pattern—a signal emerging from noise. Camera pulls back 
to reveal the pattern forms a constellation or circuit diagram. 
Cyberpunk aesthetic, teal and gold accent colors. 20 seconds.
Video 3: "Framework Architecture"
Prompt: Abstract visualization of seven translucent spheres orbiting 
a central core. Each sphere contains different imagery—one shows 
human emotions (faces), one shows maps and geography, one shows 
financial charts, one shows cultural symbols. The spheres pulse and 
exchange energy beams. Dark space background with subtle particle 
effects. Smooth, meditative camera movement. 25 seconds.

VIDEO SET 2: HARVESTER USE CASES
Video 4: "Evidence to Insight" (Harvester Hero)
Prompt: A lawyer's desk covered in chaotic stacks of paper documents, 
photos, and files. Camera slowly pushes in. The papers begin to glow 
and lift off the desk, swirling into a vortex of light. They transform 
into clean, organized digital cards that arrange themselves into a 
perfect timeline floating in space. The chaos becomes order. Dramatic 
lighting, shallow depth of field. 20 seconds.
Video 5: "Contradiction Detection"
Prompt: Two documents floating in dark space, side by side. 
Key phrases on each document illuminate and highlight themselves. 
A red connection line appears between contradicting statements, 
pulsing with warning energy. Camera zooms into the connection point 
which expands into a detailed comparison view. Forensic, analytical 
aesthetic. Teal and red accent colors. 15 seconds.
Video 6: "The Solo Practitioner"
Prompt: Cinematic shot of a solo attorney working late in a small 
office. Stacks of files surround them. They're exhausted. They open 
a laptop—the screen glows. Cut to their face illuminated by the 
screen, expression shifting from tired to focused to confident. 
Final shot: empty desk, organized, attorney leaving office while 
it's still light outside. Warm lighting progression. 25 seconds.

VIDEO SET 3: SAFETRAVEL USE CASES
Video 7: "The Voice in Your Pocket" (SafeTravel Hero)
Prompt: A traveler standing at a busy intersection in a foreign city 
at night. They look uncertain. They pull out their phone and speak 
into it. Sound waves visualize around the phone. The city around them 
transforms—dangerous areas fade to muted colors, safe paths illuminate 
in gold. They smile and walk confidently down the illuminated path. 
Cyberpunk meets travel aesthetic. 25 seconds.
Video 8: "Psychology-Aware Intel"
Prompt: Split screen showing two different travelers receiving 
information about the same destination. On the left: a cautious 
family traveler sees detailed safety protocols and family-friendly 
zones highlighted. On the right: an adventure seeker sees off-beaten 
paths and local experiences highlighted. Same data, different 
presentation. The screens merge showing the adaptive AI brain 
connecting them. Clean, modern UI aesthetic. 20 seconds.
Video 9: "Real-Time Alert"
Prompt: A digital nomad working in a café. Their phone lights up 
with an alert. Cut to a visualization of the city—a ripple expands 
from a location marking a new safety concern. The alert shows 
alternative routes glowing on a map. The nomad calmly packs up 
and relocates before anything happens. Tension to resolution arc. 
20 seconds.

VIDEO SET 4: THE FOUNDER NARRATIVE
Video 10: "Built in Isolation"
Prompt: Aerial shot of a small Caribbean island at dawn. Camera 
slowly descends toward a single lit window in a modest building. 
Through the window, we see a figure working at a computer, screens 
glowing with code and interfaces. Cut to close-up of hands typing. 
Cut to the products being built on screen. Final shot: sunrise 
over the island, the lit window now showing completed software 
interfaces. Solitary, determined, beautiful. 30 seconds.
Video 11: "Zero to One"
Prompt: Start with complete darkness. A single cursor blinks. 
Code begins to type itself, slowly at first, then accelerating. 
The code transforms into UI elements, which transform into full 
product interfaces. Camera pulls back to reveal multiple products 
orbiting around a central figure (silhouette). Text fades in: 
"Built alone. Ready to scale." Minimalist, powerful. 20 seconds.

VIDEO SET 5: FRAMEWORK SCENARIOS (Specific Use Cases)
Video 12: "Collection 2 — Emotional-Somatic in Action"
Prompt: A person watching content on a screen. We see their 
physiological response—pupil dilation, micro-expressions, posture 
shifts. These responses visualize as data streams flowing into an 
analytical system. The system outputs "RESONANCE DETECTED" with a 
confidence score. Shows how emotional response becomes measurable 
signal. Medical/analytical aesthetic with warm human elements. 
20 seconds.
Video 13: "Collection 4 — Ethnographic Mapping"
Prompt: A map of a city or region. Cultural zones begin to 
illuminate—different colors representing different community 
characteristics. Data points appear showing gathering spots, 
influence nodes, information flow patterns. The map becomes a 
living, breathing visualization of human cultural geography. 
Anthropological meets data visualization aesthetic. 25 seconds.
Video 14: "The Complete Stack"
Prompt: Seven distinct visual elements (representing 7 collections) 
floating separately in space. They begin to move toward each other, 
connecting and interlocking like a complex mechanism. When complete, 
the assembled system pulses with energy and outputs a clear signal 
beam. Camera follows the beam to its target—a clear decision or 
action. Mechanical precision meets organic flow. 30 seconds.
